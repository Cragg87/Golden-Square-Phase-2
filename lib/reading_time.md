# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can manage my time
I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that I can read 200 words a minute.

## 2. Design the Method Signature
```ruby
# this is my method:
reading_time_calculator(text)
# We will pass a large text to the method
text = a string
# and count the number of words in it
word_count = the number of words in text
# the method will return a time
word_count / 200
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

reading_time_calculator("") => 0
# returns 0 if the string is empty
reading_time_calculator("two words") => 1
# returns 1 if the string is between 1 and 200 words long
reading_time_calculator("a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a") => 2

```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
